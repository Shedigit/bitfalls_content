#Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet? Important things to consider before deciding.  
![buying online](https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/buying-online_373x.progressive.jpg)  
For anyone hoping to invest in or carry out any transaction with [Bitcoins](https://bitfalls.com%20›%20Essential), creating a bitcoin wallet is an essential first step. By now I believe you must have heard of [wallets](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) as they relate to bitcoins, and you can see more information on wallets here. In this article, we will be discussing wallet types with emphasis on their characteristics to make it easier for you to choose a wallet that suits your purpose.   

##Types of bitcoin wallets
Just like there are checking and savings accounts, there are different types of wallets that are categorized as hot wallets which correspond to checking accounts and cold wallets, which correspond to savings accounts. Every one of the many different bitcoin wallets belongs to one of these categories or the other. They serve different purposes and we will give you examples of the most popular ones under each category. Choosing which of them to use will depend on the unique characteristics of the wallet such as price (for those that are not completely free access), their security properties and ease of use which I will discuss in detail to guide you in choosing your wallet but most importantly, it depends on what you want to use the wallet for. Are you ready? OK!

###Hot Bitcoin wallets 
Our bitcoin checking accounts known as hot wallets are directly connected to the internet. For those installed on a device, the wallet is only offline if the device is disconnected from the internet for some reason. These are also referred to as software wallets, while those that are web-based are called web wallets.   

I personally like this type of wallets because watching my bitcoins grow every minute is a great pass time, but they have their shortcomings which we will get into in a second. Mobile and desktop applications fall under this category and although they are not the best of wallets, hot wallets ensure a constant supply of bitcoins on the blockchain. They also ensure circulation of the same so that wallet owners can easily withdraw funds whenever they want to.

Hot wallets however are vulnerable to attack from hackers and bitcoins can be lost if the network security is breached. Most of the lost bitcoins till date, (~ 980,000 BTC) were lost through hot wallets which is why it is not ideal for storing large amounts of bitcoins for a long time. They should only be used for spending and receiving bitcoins on the network and that’s it if you don’t want your digital assets to go down the drain.    

####Types of hot wallets
There are three types of hot wallets, the first is the desktop wallets which are designed specifically to function on computer desktops and most are compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. Desktop wallets offer the best security among hot wallets and you will be fine as long as you don’t put all your bitcoin savings on it. [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/desktop/windows/bitcoincore/) is also a desktop wallet but it also contains the full blockchain so for the sake of sending and receiving bitcoins, we will only examine the [Simple Verificat (SPV) Wallets](https://docs.electrum.org\en\latest\spv.html) wallets in this article. The following are the top desktop wallets.  

**1.	Electrum:** This is my personal favourite and the one I use. Electrum is an [open source](https://medium.com/@Spiralus/open-source-vs-closed-source-for-cryptocurrency-wallets-8ae948bb84c2) desktop wallet that is free for downloading. Being open source ensures its security which makes it a popular one among the desktop wallets. It also has a unique function that allows you to increase transaction fees for an already broadcasted transaction to make confirmation faster when transactions are too many on the blockchain and transaction fees become a prerequisite for prioritizing.  

This is one unique property that sets Electrum apart from other desktop wallets. Electrum also allows you to view all your receiving and change addresses so you can decide which address to use. However, the graphical user interface (GUI) is not very friendly. It looks very much like [R console](https://www.r-project.org/) and can be confusing to navigate unless you are really familiar with how wallets function.  
![shocked bitcoin investor on laptop](https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/shocked-bitcoin-investor-on-laptop_373x@2x.progressive.jpg)  
For those who like-fancy looking GUIs, this might not be the best wallet for you but I think the safety of your bitcoins should be the priority here, right? If you want fancy user interfaces, well, that is why we have video games. He he.   

**2.	Exodus:** Sounds like Bible exodus right? I’m not sure why they call it that, but it’s a pretty good wallet especially for those who are just starting out working with bitcoins and those who like a beautiful and relatively friendly GUI. These two properties may be responsible for its rapid popularity in the bitcoin crypto space.  

If you would like to try different cryptocurrencies, Exodus is there with you because it also supports popular [altcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp) such as Ethereum and Litecoin, making it possible to have all your cryptocurrencies in one super wallet.   

However unlike Electrum, Exodus isn’t completely open source, which compromises its integrity as malwares can be introduced in this wallet without you knowing.   This can lead to loss of your funds should the malware attack your computer. Remember, do not store funds you are not ready to lose on a hot wallet!   

**3.	Copay:** This is a [multisig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) or multisignature wallet which means it requires multiple signatures to spend the bitcoins. This gives security to this wallet and makes it a good alternative for cold wallets especially hardware wallets which have to be bought. It is also open source which gives it extra security.   

Another cool thing is that Copay is compatible with all three major operating systems and mobile devices so almost anyone can download and install it on their machine or smartphone.  
![BC Logo](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/2/29/BC_Logo_.png)

**4.	Armory:** As the name implies (like armor), this is another popular wallet with a great deal of security features. It allows you to use various encryptions and is also a good alternative for hardware wallets with its significantly higher security.   

The downside is that it can be a bit of a headache navigating it for newbies but those who are used to bitcoins and wallets will find it very useful. Oh and another thing – the GUI looks like that of Electrum in some way so you decide what you want.  

The second class of hot wallets is the mobile wallets. For those who love to carry their hot wallets like physical leather wallets, this is where to look. I really like to monitor how my bitcoins are doing and to carry out transactions on the go so this works well for me.   

Mobile wallets run on both android and iOS but as much fun and ease as these wallets provide, it is noteworthy that mobile wallets are much less secure than desktop wallets since mobile devices are easily stolen or destroyed, which means complete loss of funds if it does happen.  
 
However as a precaution, modern mobile wallets have seed phrases (12-24 words in length) used to backup and reproduce private and public keys of the wallet should the device be lost or destroyed. I used my 12-word seed phrase recently to restore my lost Mycelium wallet on Electrum and you wouldn’t believe the simplicity of the process.  
 
The following are good, commonly used mobile wallets you should consider using if you like to carry your wallet with you.  
![handful of bitcoin coins](https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/handful-of-bitcoin-cryptocurrency_373x.progressive.jpg)
 
**1.	Mycelium:** My favourite and undoubtedly the most popular mobile wallet, Mycelium comes with high security and a lot of safety features including a 12-word seed phrase being a Hierarchical Deterministic [(HD) wallet](https://coinsutra.com/hd-wallets-deterministic-wallet/). It can also be used hand in hand with a hardware wallet and regular updates are done on the software, which gives it a higher level of security.   

Mycelium has a relatively complex GUI which may be a bit difficult for newbies but is really appealing to look at, if it’s any consolation. If you are excited about bitcoins and love a challenge, go for Mycelium even as a newbie. I’m sure you’ll figure out how to use it, just make sure you don’t lose your money.  

**2.	BreadWallet:** If you are a newbie looking to get used to working with wallets, BreadWallet is the way to go. It is an easy to use, open source wallet with just enough features for basic sending and receiving of bitcoins.  

Its simplicity however makes it vulnerable and so is not very safe but again, do not put a lot of money in it or any hot wallet for that matter. BreadWallet is available for both Android and iOS and is freely available for download and installation. You can try this one if you are scared of trying Mycelium.  

**Web wallets**  
 
The third class of hot wallets are the web wallets which are entirely online all the time and are accessed using web browsers such as Explorer, Firefox and Chrome on computers or mobile devices. Web wallets are ideal for those venturing into bitcoin investment for the first time and most of them are free. If you don’t want to install a software wallet on your device or buy a hardware wallet then this is an option you should consider. See the most popular web [wallets](https://www.disruptordaily.com/best-web-wallets-for-cryptocurrency-top-10-of-2017/).

###Cold Bitcoin wallets  ![laptop and memory card](http://publicdomainarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/240x0_100_1_c_FFFFFF_285d188edadd9e8e88f55dac68e054cb.jpg) 
 
Cold wallets or cold storage are the category of wallets that correspond to saving accounts. They are completely offline and are therefore not prone to attacks from hackers or malware. These wallets are only used for transfer of bitcoins when there is need but are majorly just a means of storing bitcoins.  
 
Bitcoins stored on cold wallets are non-accessible to online users and cannot be withdrawn so it is not in circulation. Hardware and paper wallets fall under this category and are actually separate from any mobile device or desktop.  

[Paper wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet) are considered a form of cold wallet but because they are much more prone to destruction, it is safer to go with hardware wallets. The only problem with cold wallets is that they may be easily stolen or destroyed like mobile devices despite the great security they provide. The bottom line is, make sure they are well kept to avoid damage or stealing.  
 
There are a number of hardware wallets in existence and they are the best choice for those who are serious about storing bitcoins for a long time. The only problem? They have to be paid for and some people may not be able to afford this, but you can spend up to 200 dollars to secure millions of dollars right? So get one. The following are the top hardware wallets you should choose from.  

**1.	Ledger Nano S:** This wallet comes as an easy to use and carry device and is completely safe being a hardware wallet. Ledger Nano S also supports several altcoins so you can own several different digital currencies on it without having to spend money buying separate hardware for other currencies. The wallet costs only €118 and shipping is free to many countries around the globe. You can easily purchase it [online](https://bitfalls.com/product-category/wallets/).  
![wooden walkway across ocean](http://publicdomainarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/240x0_100_1_c_FFFFFF_6e490fd8768c29d8a997a7c2230bfa38.jpg) 

**2.	Trezor:** This is the oldest hardware wallet and a very trustworthy one too. It is now second to Nano S but still more expensive and has a good reputation probably because one of its founders was a key player in bitcoin blockchain development. It also has a great user interface that is easy to use and can be used to store Zcash, Dash and Ethereum.  

**3.	Keepkey:** This is a simple but highly secure hardware wallet that not only supports Bitcoin but almost all altcoins. It is also enabled for exchange of all currencies supported by the device so exchanging digital assets doesn’t have to be a hassle. You remember I said I recovered my wallet with a 12-word phrase? Keepkey has the same security feature which means you can get back everything with a simple 12-word security phrase if the device gets stolen or damaged.  

It is completely resistant to viruses and malware, and is compatible with all desktop operating systems and android devices so you should try this one if you can afford it.  
 
##Conclusion 
We have examined all the different wallets and their characteristics such as security, simplicity of use and cost. It is now left for you to decide which to use if you have a clear view of what you want to use the wallet for so now I will ask you this question, which are you going for?
